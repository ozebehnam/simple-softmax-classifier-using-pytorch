# simple-softmax-classifier-using-pytorch
A very simple softmax classifier using Pytorch framework
As every Data scientist know we have lots of activation function like sigmoid, relu, and even sigmoid used for different targets, in this code you can learn how to use the softmax function in the PyTorch framework, to have multi probabilities.
